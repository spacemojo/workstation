# workstation
This is my current set of tools, scripts, configs, etc .. that I use on a daily basis on my workstation.

## Reason for this repo
I am starting out at a new job, and when we talk new job, we talk new workstation. So in the next couple of days, I'll be setting up with my usual set of tools and I thought it would be nice to document, even script, the process of getting ready with my favorite set of tools for software engineering. 

Obviously, I won't share what is confidential and directly related to my employer. So the scope of this is around the tooling I use for general software development, architecture, devops and documentation. This is gonna be fun.
